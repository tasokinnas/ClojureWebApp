# CS 354 Group Project: Clojure

* Authors: Taso Kinnas, Wes Gruenberg, Nikki Semmelroth
* Class: CS354
* Semester: Spring 2017


## Overview

Concisely explain what the program does. If this exceeds a couple of
sentences, you're going too far. Generally you should be pulling this
right from the project specification. I don't want you to just cut and
paste, but paraphrase what is stated in the project specification.


## Compiling and Using

In order to run the web server, you will want to have leinengren installed.
Follw the instructions at: https://leiningen.org/

To start web server and view via web, in the clojure-web-project directory:
```
$ lein run (Mac/Linux)
$ lein.bat run (Windows)
```

To run the REPL on the command line:
```
$ lein repl (Mac/Linux)
$ lein.bat repl (Windows)
```

To run the REPL in IntelliJ:
```
1) Start the LEIN REPL
For file you want to test functions -
2) Right click in the wondow of the file showing the code
3) REPL -> load file in REPL
4) REPL -> switch NS to local file
5) run your functions

```

## Discussion

Discuss the issues you encountered during programming (development)
and testing. What problems did you have? What did you have to
research and learn on your own? What kinds of errors did you get? How
did you fix them?

What parts of the project did you find challenging? Is there anything
that finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this
project?
